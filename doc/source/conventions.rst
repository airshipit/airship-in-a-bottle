Airship Conventions
===================
Airship components conform to a minimal set of conventions to
provide for reasonable levels of consistency.

Language
--------
While these documents are not an IETF RFC, `RFC 2119`_ provides for useful
language definitions. In this spirit:

-  'must', 'shall', 'will', and 'required' language indicates inflexible rules.
-  'should' and 'recommended' language is expected to be followed but reasonable
   exceptions may exist.
-  'may' and 'can' language is intended to be optional, but will provide a
   recommended approach if used.
